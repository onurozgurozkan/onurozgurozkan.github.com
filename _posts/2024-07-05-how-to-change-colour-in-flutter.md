For instance, [Hipcall](https://www.hipcall.com/en-us/brand-and-design-guide/)â€™s 
default color is `025196`. To use this hex color in Flutter, prefix it with 
`0xFF` and then use it like this: `Color(0xFF025196)`.

```dart
theme: ThemeData(
  colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Color(0xFF025196)),
  useMaterial3: true,
),
```
